Operating the Engine,Clean Exhaust Filter Safely,"During exhaust filter cleaning operations, the engine may run at elevated idle and hot temperatures for an extended period of time. Exhaust gases and exhaust filter components reach temperatures hot enough to burn people, or ignite or melt common materials.

Keep machine away from people, animals, or structures which may be susceptible to harm or damage from hot exhaust gases or components. Avoid potential fire or explosion hazards from flammable materials and vapors near the exhaust. Keep exhaust outlet away from people and anything that can melt, burn, or explode.

Closely monitor machine and surrounding area for smoldering debris during and after exhaust filter cleaning.

Adding fuel while an engine is running can create a fire or explosion hazard. Always stop engine before refueling machine and clean up any spilled fuel.

Always make sure that engine is stopped while hauling machine on a truck or trailer.

Contact with exhaust components while still hot can result in serious personal injury.

Avoid contact with these components until cooled to safe temperatures.

If service procedure requires engine to be running:

Only engage power-driven parts required by service procedure

Ensure that other people are clear of operator station and machine

Keep hands, feet, and clothing away from power-driven parts.

Operating the Engine,Aftertreatment Indicators Overview,"The operator will be informed by the operator warning system when the emission control system does not function correctly and/or an engine malfunction is detected by the engine control unit. Ignoring the operator warning signals will lead to an emission related derate, resulting in an effective disablement of non-road mobile machinery operation.

It is essential to take prompt action to rectify any incorrect operation, use or maintenance of the emissions control system in accordance with the rectification measures indicated by the warnings referenced below.

The Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) indicator illuminates when the DEF is low. Fill DEF tank.

When the DEF indicator is combined with the warning indicator or engine stop indicator engine performance is reduced by the Engine Control Unit (ECU) because the DEF is below a measurable level. Fill DEF tank.

When engine emissions temperature indicator illuminates exhaust gas temperature is high, elevated idle is active, or exhaust filter cleaning is in process. The machine can be operated as normal unless the operator determines the machine is not in a safe location for high exhaust temperatures and disables auto cleaning.

When engine emissions temperature indicator is combined with the warning indicator or engine stop indicator engine performance is reduced by the ECU because the exhaust gas temperature is higher than expected. Follow Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) procedure or see your authorized servicing dealer.

When the exhaust filter indicator illuminates the exhaust filter cleaning is in process, aftertreatment system has a fault, or the exhaust filter is in need of cleaning and the operator has disabled auto exhaust filter cleaning. If conditions are safe, the operator should enable the auto exhaust filter clean setting or perform manual service regeneration or follow DTC procedure.

When the exhaust filter indicator is combined with the warning indicator engine performance is reduced by the ECU because there is an aftertreatment system fault or the soot level of the exhaust filter is moderately high. If conditions are safe, the operator should enable the auto exhaust filter clean function. If conditions are not safe, the operator should move the machine to a safe location and engage the auto exhaust filter cleaning mode. Perform manual service regeneration or follow DTC procedure.

When the exhaust filter indicator is combined with the engine stop indicator engine performance is further reduced by the ECU because there is an aftertreatment system fault or the soot level of the exhaust filter is extremely high. If this combination is present, see your authorized servicing dealer.

The auto cleaning disabled indicator illuminates when the operator has engaged the request to disable the auto exhaust filter cleaning function. This icon remains illuminated until the operator re-engages automatic exhaust filter cleaning from the diagnostic gauge. Disabling auto mode is not recommended for any situation unless it is safety-related or if the fuel tank lacks the required fuel to complete the cleaning process.

The engine emissions system malfunction indicator illuminates when engine emissions are outside of normal operating range or engine emissions system fault. Follow DTC procedure or see your authorized servicing dealer.

Modify To:

Harvest standing crop of different heights in the same field.

Assist in picking up downed crop.

Clean off the cutter bar at the end of a cut.

Set to optimize crop flow:

Standing Crop (with Height Sensing Active)— position the reel above the cutterbar so that it slightly touches the grain heads. This helps the crop fall into the platform.

In small grain crops, place the reel slightly in front of the auger to allow the crop to fall into the auger. Position the reel tines straight down or slightly forward. If the crop starts to turn with the reel, the reel position setting is too low. If you see crop being hit by the reel and bouncing back and forth before being cut, reduce the reel speed. Too fast of a reel speed will result in header losses.

Down Crop (with Float Mode Active)— place the reel in front of the cutterbar so that the reel can rake up the crop. Position the reel tines backward to help with lifting the crop. Consider the use of crop lifters if they are available for your platform type.

Headland Turns (with Height Resume Active)— position the reel as close as possible to the cutterbar. This prevents crop from falling out of the platform during a headland turn.

Engine Application,Exhaust Filter System Overview,"Your machine is equipped with an emission-compliant engine, which cleans and filters the exhaust. Under normal machine operation and with the system in AUTO mode, the system requires minimal operator interaction.

To avoid the unnecessary buildup of diesel particulates or soot in the exhaust filter system:

Auto Exhaust Filter Cleaning Utilize AUTO Exhaust Filter Cleaning mode.

Avoid unnecessary idling.

Use proper engine oil.

Use only ultra low sulfur fuel.

For more information, refer to Fuels and Lubricants section in the machine Operator's Manual.

When AUTO or PARKED cleaning is enabled, the exhaust temperature can be high under no load or light load conditions at certain times during the exhaust filter cleaning cycle.

Servicing machine or attachments during the exhaust filter cleaning can result in serious personal injury. Avoid exposure and skin contact with hot exhaust gases and components.

During auto or manual/stationary exhaust filter cleaning operations, the engine runs at elevated temperatures for up to 45 minutes. To avoid injury or fire, verify exhaust filter, components, and outlet are free of debris. During entire cleaning process, keep exhaust outlet away from people, buildings, and anything that can melt, burn, or explode.

AUTO Mode— automated process that performs exhaust filter cleaning during normal operation.

Disable AUTO Exhaust Filter— in conditions where it can be unsafe for elevated exhaust temperatures.

Parked Filter Cleaning Parked Filter Cleaning— process which allows the system to perform additional exhaust filter cleaning when required.

Recording of a sample starts when the ActiveYieldActiveYield is a trademark of Deere & Company sensors are fully covered with grain and stops at about 3000 kg (6614 lbs). A sample can be rejected in the following conditions:

Inconsistent Flow— the mass flow variation was too large to generate acceptable calibration load.

Uneven Loading/Grain Pile Shift Detected— grain tank loading was not within the parameters to generate an accepted calibration load. This could be due to excessive grain shifts in the grain tank caused by quick acceleration/deceleration of the machine or travelling over rough terrain.

Pitch or Roll Too Large— if the pitch or roll angle of the machine was larger than 4° during sample collection, the load will be rejected.

Collection Interrupted— if harvesting stopped or the unloading auger was engaged while sample collection was in progress, the load will be rejected.

400 Seconds Exceeded— a load will be rejected if it has not reached its minimum load size after 400 seconds (6 minutes and 40 seconds).

Mass Flow Vibration Calibration Not Conducted— not performing the mass flow vibration calibration can trigger inconsistent flow conditions or cause the mass flow to not be detected at all. A load can be rejected or will not start to be recorded.

The offset correction is only valid until the next accepted load is collected. ActiveYield­™ adjusts the yield calibration as more loads are accepted.

Procedure to Determine Offset Correction:

Do not adjust the correction value with less than 15 accepted samples completed.

Harvest at least 15 accepted samples at a consistent moisture and ground speed.

Harvest and scale-check 5 full grain tank loads. Compare the wet weight of each load to the measured scale weight for the same load.

Menu Select Menu.

Applications Select the Applications tab.

Work Totals Select the Work Totals application.

Load Totals Select the Load Totals tab.

Note the wet weight for each of the 5 loads.

Calculate the difference between the wet weight of each load determined by the machine and the measured scale weight of each load as a percentage.

To calculate the difference as a percentage:

Wet Weight - Scale Weight = Difference

Difference ÷ Scale Weight x 100 = Offset Correction Value (as a percentage)

Repeat this calculation for the remaining 4 loads.

Calculate the average offset correction value of the 5 loads:

Offset Correction Value 1 + Offset Correction Value 2 + Offset Correction Value 3 + Offset Correction Value 4 + Offset Correction Value 5 = Total

Total ÷ 5 = Average Offset Correction Value (as a percentage)

Correction Value Enter the average offset correction value into the Correction Value input box.

Procedure Requirements:

Operating State

Harvesting and separating functions are stopped.

Ensure that accidental activation of machinery is not possible.

Engine State

Key switch in the RUN position is required. Can also be performed with the engine running.

Procedure Overview:

Begin Select Begin to begin the procedure.

Find and physically tap each sensor to test for signal response. For best results, tap the sensors with a metallic object like a screwdriver.

After striking each sensor, you will see either a green check mark or a red strikethrough.

Green Check Mark A green check mark indicates the sensor signal test was successful.

Red Strikethrough A red strikethrough indicates an error state.

Gray Circle A gray circle indicates the sensor has not been tested yet.

Done Select Done at any time to close the grain loss monitor sensor tap test screen and return to the previous screen.

Reset Select Reset to return all sensors to their default states to test again.

If Calibration Fails:

If the test fails twice, change the crop type to a medium grain, such as wheat or barley, and repeat the test on the failed sensors. The strike detection algorithm is tuned differently for different crop types. Striking the sensor with a screwdriver is different compared to striking the sensor with a seed or piece of grain.

If a sensor tap test continues to fail, see your John Deere dealer or qualified service provider.

Ground Drive and Rear Axle,Service Tires Safely,"Explosive separation of a tire and rim parts can cause serious injury or death.

Do not attempt to mount a tire unless you have the proper equipment and experience to perform the job.

Always maintain the correct tire pressure. Do not inflate the tires above the recommended pressure.

Never weld or heat a wheel and tire assembly. The heat can cause an increase in air pressure resulting in a tire explosion. Welding can structurally weaken or deform the wheel.

When inflating tires, use a clip-on chuck and extension hose long enough to allow you to stand to one side and NOT in front of or over the tire assembly. Use a safety cage if available.

Check wheels for low pressure, cuts, bubbles, damaged rims or missing lug bolts and nuts."

Ground Drive and Rear Axle,Care and Service of Tires,"Installing tires that do not meet original equipment tire specifications may cause machine malfunction. Consult your dealer or tire supplier for guidance.

Use of substandard tires or larger than recommended tires will void warranty and may decrease stability, affect steering, result in premature tire failure, or cause other durability or safety issues.

Check tires daily for damage or noticeably low pressure.

At least every 100 hours of operation, check tire pressure. If tires contain liquid ballast, use a special air-water gauge and measure with valve stem at bottom.

A small puncture in a tubeless tire can be temporarily repaired without dismounting the tire, thus avoiding down time during a busy season.

Protect tires from exposure to sunlight, petroleum products, and chemicals.

Drive carefully. Try to avoid rocks and sharp objects.

A permanent repair should be made as soon as possible to prevent further tire damage.

Tire information and specifications are based on the latest information available at the time of publication. The right is reserved to make changes at any time without notice. See the online Combine Ag Sales Manual or your John Deere dealer for further information on Tire Pressure Charts.

Tire pressures listed in charts may differ from the tire pressures shown on the side of the tires.

Header compatibility and specified inflation pressures are based on front axle load of a coarse grain configuration.

Load varies based on configuration. This may not reflect the worst case scenario. Consult your local tire dealer if in doubt.

Not all tires are available on all machines or at all manufacturing facilities.

Onboard Air Compressor (if equipped) - not recommended to inflate tires on the machine or run air tools."

Ground Drive and Rear Axle,Using Liquid Weight,"Valve Stem Installing liquid weight (ballast) requires special equipment and training.

Cover rim completely with solution to avoid corrosion, but NEVER fill any tire more than 90% full. More solution would leave too little air space to absorb shocks. Damage to tire could occur.

A solution of water and calcium chloride provides a safe and economical ballast. Used properly, it will not damage tires, tubes, or rims.

Use calcium chloride to prevent water from freezing. A mixture of 1.6 kg (3-1/2 lb) of calcium chloride per 3.8 L (1 gal) will not freeze solid above -45°C (-50°F).

Use of alcohol as liquid ballast is not recommended. Calcium chloride solution is heavier and more economical.

Fill tubeless tires at least to valve level (minimum 75% full). Less solution would expose part of rim, possibly causing corrosion. Tube-type tires may be filled to any level below 90%."
Ground Drive and Rear Axle,Ballast Requirements,"Ballast requirements vary based on configuration.

Ballast requirements are based off standard Corn Pricing configuration, 133 L (35 gal) fuel in tank, and full grain tank. This may not reflect all scenarios.

Tires requiring fluid must be filled to 75%.

Harvesting Hints,Operation at Low Temperatures,"When operating in cold temperatures, verify that proper grade diesel fuel is being used. Warmer grade diesel fuel will gel in fuel lines, fuel filters, and fuel tank. Fuel system requires servicing if diesel fuel gels. See Fuels and Lubricants section for further information.

Combine functions can degrade in low temperatures where snow and ice are present. Special care MUST be taken to ensure that minimal snow is ingested in combine. If snow is ingested, areas such as chaffer, cleaning fan, separator concaves, and separator grates can become obstructed. Operation with these areas obstructed could cause machine damage and significant repairs or result in functional performance degradation. Consult your John Deere dealer prior to operating in cold temperatures."
Harvesting Hints,Harvesting Tips,"Adjust machine to crop being harvested and to field conditions.

Select a ground speed that does not overload machine. Engine must be at full rpm to keep separator at full speed. Select a ground speed for slower travel, but do not slow engine speed.

If the concave is set too close for the harvested crop, straw will be excessively ground up requiring more horsepower to thresh the crop.

If the concave is set too wide for the harvested crop, it will not be completely threshed.

After threshing clearance is adjusted properly, adjust separator speed to achieve maximum threshing with the least amount of crop damage. If crop damage does occur, reduce feed accelerator speed. Threshing clearance in these crops has very little effect on seed damage.

Crops such as edible beans and peas are easily cracked and can require the use of a slower feed accelerator drive. When harvesting edible beans and peas keep machine full to provide enough material to cushion the crop against cracking.

For potential improvements in straw quality consider that the following can help improve straw quality depending on conditions:

Slowing feeder house chain speed

Slowing feed accelerator speed

Slowing rotor speed

Opening concave

Reducing threshing elements

Installing round bar concaves

For improved performance in sidehill conditions, consider trying the following:

Adjust the position of the angled dividers on the front step pan to improve shoe distribution.

Install tall chaffer dividers (available from your John Deere dealer).

Install separator grate covers (if equipped) to improve the chaff and grain distribution.

Each of these actions can improve the chaff and grain distribution to the cleaning shoe, resulting in improved performance in sidehill conditions.

When using a cutting platform, cut crop as high as possible without loss of low heads. Adjust reel position and speed for even feeding. Keep cutterbar in register and guards in alignment for clean cutting.

When harvesting corn, keep corn head only as low as necessary for ears. Keep it centered in the rows to prevent ear loss.

When using a belt pickup, keep windrow centered so material is fed evenly into the feeder house. Grain heads must be lying in one direction. Operate machine so heads are picked up first.

When harvesting soybeans with a row-crop head, keep header as low as possible. When harvesting crops such as milo or sunflowers, operate header just low enough to cut the heads from the stalks.

Adjust chaffer openings to pass grain or seed to the lower sieve in the first two-thirds of the chaffer without admitting too much coarse material.

Use as much air as possible without blowing over clean grain and seed. Heavy crops require more air than light seed crops."

Harvesting Hints,Single Point Yield Calibration Or Multi-Point Yield Calibration,"Speed Variations Crop Flow Variations ALoad 1 BLoad 2 CLoad 3 DLoad 4 EMinimum Flow FMedium Flow GMedium Flow HMaximum Flow Varying machine ground speed is the best way to vary the flow rate.

The best way to keep the flow rate constant is to monitor the VisionTrakVisionTrak is a trademark of Deere & Company display and adjust machine ground speed accordingly.

Single point yield calibration is performed when one or up to three calibration loads are collected.

This type of calibration is suggested when the harvested field has a fairly consistent yield and machine is operated at a constant ground speed with little flow variation.

To collect a calibration load, harvest approximately 2722 kg (6000 lb) at the maximum harvest speed.

Running one or two additional loads is not required, but it may allow the system to average the overall error.

Multi-point yield calibration is used when the harvested field is expected to have varying yields or machine is operated at varying speeds with varying grain flows.

This type of calibration collects each calibration load at each expected flow condition.

For each calibration load, harvest approximately 2722 kg (6000 lb).

Run at least four calibration loads over various ground speeds (A—D) or at different cut widths to simulate four different flow rates (E—H)."

Crop Settings,Power Shutdown Procedure,"A power shutdown is used to determine the machine’s performance in the threshing and separating areas by taking a ""snapshot"" of the material in the separator. This is valuable in determining where the losses behind the machine are generated and what adjustments can be made to correct the condition.

Verify that crop condition and material intake is similar for each shutdown.

Locate engine speed indicator on corner post display and threshing speed readout on armrest display.

Lock brake pedals together.

Operate machine at optimized throughput levels in the desired crop.

Move steering wheel forward for free motion (both hands needed).

Press low idle engine speed switch on armrest.

The machine is designed to have a slower draw down of the engine rpm and more of a run-on for separator components.

Lightly depress brake pedals (machine attempts to repower and downshifts changing the machine dynamics if brakes are fully depressed).

Header Engage Switch/Separator Engage Switch As engine speed drops and nears low idle speed (1200 rpm), quickly disengage header engage switch and separator engage switch on armrest.

Quickly move the multi-function lever to neutral position.

Allow engine to cool for a minute.

Key Switch Turn key switch to shut OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key.

Inspect for excessive grain damage, kernels left on the cobs, uneven distribution of material on the return pan and cleaning shoe, and free grain loss before making any adjustments.

Decide what adjustments are needed. Open threshing clearance and engage separator (avoids undue stress to cylinder drive area during cleanout).

Adjust machine to desired settings and continue harvesting.

Repeat this procedure and verify grain quality and losses behind machine.

Once acceptable loss levels are attained, calibrate VisionTrakVisionTrak is a trademark of Deere & Company Monitor and continue to harvest."

Fire Prevention,In Case of Fire,"Avoid personal injury.

Stop machine immediately at the first sign of fire. Fire may be identified by the smell of smoke or sight of flames. Because fire grows and spreads rapidly, get off the machine immediately and move safely away from the fire. Do not return to the machine! The number one priority is safety.

Call the fire department. A portable fire extinguisher can put out a small fire or contain it until the fire department arrives; but portable extinguishers have limitations. Always put the safety of the operator and bystanders first. If attempting to extinguish a fire, keep your back to the wind with an unobstructed escape path so you can move away quickly if the fire cannot be extinguished.

Read the fire extinguisher instructions and become familiar with their location, parts, and operation before a fire starts. Local fire departments or fire equipment distributors may offer fire extinguisher training and recommendations.

If your extinguisher does not have instructions, follow these general guidelines:

Pull the pin. Hold the extinguisher with the nozzle pointing away from you, and release the locking mechanism.

Aim low. Point the extinguisher at the base of the fire.

Squeeze the lever slowly and evenly.

Sweep the nozzle from side-to-side."
Fire Prevention,Cleaning Engine Compartment,"Clean Engine Compartment Do not clean engine or engine compartment with engine running. Dirt, oil, chaff, and crop debris in engine compartment and on engine is a fire hazard. Direction of wind, type of crop, and crop moisture content can all have an effect on where and how much chaff and debris accumulate. Check and clean this area frequently."
Machine Cleanout,General Cleaning Guidelines,"Machine must be inspected periodically throughout the harvest day. Buildup of crop material and other debris must be removed to ensure proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire. Frequency of inspections and cleanings vary depending on a number of factors, including operating conditions, machine settings, crop conditions, operating speeds, and weather conditions. Inspections and cleanings may be required multiple times throughout the harvest day, particularly in dry, hot, and windy conditions. Wet crop conditions can also pose a fire risk under some circumstances.

Regular and thorough cleaning of machine combined with other routine maintenance procedures listed in the Operator’s Manual greatly reduce the risk of fire, chance of costly downtime, and improve machine performance.

Crop material and other debris can accumulate in various areas. Direction of wind, type of crop, and crop moisture content can all impact where and how much crop material and debris can accumulate. Be aware of harvest conditions and adjust your cleaning schedule to ensure proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire. Inspect and clean these areas as needed throughout the harvest day.

Harvesting certain crops can cause special issues. Some crops are very “sticky” and it is often more difficult to clean the machine when harvesting these crops. Examples of these crops include, but are not limited to sunflower, canola, and safflower. Take special care in cleaning the machine when harvesting these types of crops.

Always follow all safety procedures posted on the machine and in the Operator’s Manual. Before carrying out any inspection or cleaning, always shut OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key."

Machine Cleanout,Cleaning Out Machine (Periodic Cleanout),"The photographs in this section show areas of the machine that require regular inspection and cleaning. While there are other areas that require regular cleaning, frequent attention to these areas provides the greatest impact on fire prevention.

Some of these photographs show accumulations of crop material and other debris prior to cleaning. This type of accumulation is not normal; it was allowed for illustrative purposes only.

These areas may require more frequent cleaning, even multiple times per day, depending on harvest conditions. Be aware of harvest conditions and adjust your cleaning schedule to ensure proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire.

Other areas not covered in this section may also collect crop debris and MUST be cleaned periodically for machine function and appearance. Thoroughly inspect the entire machine on a regular basis throughout the harvest season.

Before carrying out any inspection or cleaning, always shut OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key.

Thoroughly clean machine from top to bottom with compressed air. First, clean all areas accessible from the engine deck. Panels or covers may need to be removed or opened to access areas for cleaning. Start with engine compartment and work outwards and counterclockwise to other areas around engine compartment, floor underneath engine, top rear of rotor, and rear deck, including areas around exhaust aftertreatment enclosure (if equipped). Once top areas of machine are clean, proceed to cleaning areas accessible from the ground level.

From the ground level, clean rear underside of fuel tank area and top of the rear tailboard of the residue disposal system. Once the cleaning from the ground level is finished, recheck engine compartment for any crop debris that could have blown in from the ground level cleaning.

Fuels and Lubricants,Handle Fuel Safely—Avoid Fires,"Handle fuel with care: it is highly flammable. Do not refuel the machine while smoking or when near open flame or sparks.

Always stop engine before refueling machine. Fill fuel tank outdoors.

Prevent fires by keeping machine clean of accumulated trash, grease, and debris. Always clean up spilled fuel.

Use only an approved fuel container for transporting flammable liquids.

Never fill fuel container in pickup truck with plastic bed liner. Always place fuel container on ground before refueling. Touch fuel container with fuel dispenser nozzle before removing can lid. Keep fuel dispenser nozzle in contact with fuel container inlet when filling.

Do not store fuel container where there is an open flame, spark, or pilot light such as within a water heater or other appliance."
Fuels and Lubricants,Avoid Static Electricity Risk When Refueling,"The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity and increases its ability to store a static charge.

Refineries may have treated the fuel with a static dissipating additive. However, there are many factors that can reduce the effectiveness of the additive over time.

Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it is flowing through fuel delivery systems. Static electricity discharge when combustible vapors are present could result in a fire or explosion.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entire system used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank, transfer pump, transfer hose, nozzle, and others) is properly grounded and bonded. Consult with your fuel or fuel system supplier to ensure that the delivery system is in compliance with fueling standards for proper grounding and bonding practices."

Fuels and Lubricants,Handling and Storing Diesel Fuel,"Reduce the risk of fire. Handle fuel carefully. DO NOT fill the fuel tank when engine is running. DO NOT smoke while you fill the fuel tank or service the fuel system.

Fill the fuel tank at the end of each day's operation to prevent water condensation and freezing during cold weather.

Keep all storage tanks as full as practicable to minimize condensation.

Ensure that all fuel tank caps and covers are installed properly to prevent moisture from entering. Monitor water content of the fuel regularly.

When using BioDiesel fuel, the fuel filter may require more frequent replacement due to premature plugging.

Check engine oil level daily prior to starting engine. A rising oil level may indicate fuel dilution of the engine oil.

When fuel is stored for an extended period or if there is a slow turnover of fuel, add a fuel conditioner to stabilize the fuel and prevent water condensation. Contact your fuel supplier or John Deere dealer for recommendations."
Fuels and Lubricants,Diesel Fuel,"Consult your local fuel distributor for properties of the diesel fuel available in your area.

In general, diesel fuels are blended to satisfy the low temperature requirements of the geographical area in which they are marketed.

Diesel fuels specified to EN 590 or ASTM D975 are recommended. Renewable diesel fuel produced by hydrotreating animal fats and vegetable oils is basically identical to petroleum diesel fuel. Renewable diesel that meets EN 590, ASTM D975, or EN 15940 is acceptable for use at all percentage mixture levels.

In all cases, the fuel shall meet the following properties:

Cetane number of 40 minimum. Cetane number greater than 47 is preferred, especially for temperatures below –20 °C (–4 °F) or elevations above 1675 m (5500 ft.).

Cloud Point should be below the expected lowest ambient temperature or Cold Filter Plugging Point (CFPP) should be a maximum 10°C (18°F) below the fuel cloud point.

Fuel lubricity should pass a maximum scar diameter of 0.52 mm as measured by ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1. A maximum scar diameter of 0.45 mm is preferred.

Diesel fuel quality and sulfur content must comply with all existing emissions regulations for the area in which the engine operates. DO NOT use diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than 10 000 mg/kg (10 000 ppm).

Materials such as copper, lead, zinc, tin, brass and bronze should be avoided in fuel handling, distribution and storage equipment as these metals can catalyze fuel oxidation reactions which can lead to fuel system deposits and plugged fuel filters.

DO NOT use E-Diesel (Diesel fuel and ethanol blend). Use of E-Diesel fuel in any John Deere machine may void the machine warranty.

Avoid severe injury or death due to the fire and explosion risk from using E-Diesel fuel.

Use ONLY diesel fuel with a maximum of 500 mg/kg (500 ppm) sulfur content.

Use ONLY ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel with a maximum of 15 mg/kg (15 ppm) sulfur content.

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 1000 mg/kg (1000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 1000—2000 mg/kg (1000—2000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.

BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than 2000 mg/kg (2000 ppm), contact your John Deere dealer.

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 2000 mg/kg (2000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 2000—5000 mg/kg (2000—5000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.See DX,ENOIL12,OEM, DX,ENOIL12,T2,STD, or DX,ENOIL12,T2,EXT for more information on Engine Oil and Filter Service Intervals.

BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than 5000 mg/kg (5000 ppm), contact your John Deere dealer.

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 5000 mg/kg (5000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than 5000 mg/kg (5000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.

Do not mix used diesel engine oil or any other type of lubricating oil with diesel fuel.

Improper fuel additive usage may cause damage on fuel injection equipment of diesel engines."
Fuels and Lubricants,Biodiesel Fuel,"Biodiesel fuel is comprised of monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel blends are biodiesel mixed with petroleum diesel fuel on a volume basis.

Before using fuel containing biodiesel, review the Biodiesel Use Requirements and Recommendations in this Operator’s Manual.

Environmental laws and regulations can encourage or prohibit the use of biofuels. Operators should consult with appropriate governmental authorities prior to using biofuels.

Where the engine is to be operated within the Union on diesel or non-road gas-oil, a fuel with a FAME content not greater than 8% volume/volume (B8) shall be used.

Biodiesel blends up to B20 can be used ONLY if the biodiesel (100% biodiesel or B100) meets ASTM D6751, EN 14214, or equivalent specification. Expect a 2% reduction in power and a 3% reduction in fuel economy when using B20.

Biodiesel concentrations above B20 can harm the engine’s emission control systems and should not be used. Risks include, but are not limited to, more frequent stationary regeneration, soot accumulation, and increased intervals for ash removal.

John Deere Fuel conditioners or equivalent, which contain detergent and dispersant additives, are required when using biodiesel blends from B10 to B20, and are recommended when using lower biodiesel blends.

Biodiesel blends up to B20 can be used ONLY if the biodiesel (100% biodiesel or B100) meets ASTM D6751, EN 14214, or equivalent specification. Expect a 2% reduction in power and a 3% reduction in fuel economy when using B20.

These John Deere engines can operate on biodiesel blends above B20 (up to 100% biodiesel). Operate at levels above B20 ONLY if the biodiesel is permitted by law and meets the EN 14214 specification (primarily available in Europe). Engines operating on biodiesel blends above B20 might not fully comply with or be permitted by all applicable emissions regulations. Expect up to a 12% reduction in power and an 18% reduction in fuel economy when using 100% biodiesel.

John Deere fuel conditioners or equivalent, which contain detergent and dispersant additives, are required when using biodiesel blends from B10 to B100, and are recommended when using lower biodiesel blends.

The petroleum diesel portion of all biodiesel blends must meet the requirements of ASTM D975 (US) or EN 590 (EU) commercial standard.

Biodiesel users in the U.S. are strongly encouraged to purchase biodiesel blends from a BQ-9000 Certified Marketer and sourced from a BQ-9000 Accredited Producer (as certified by the National biodiesel Board). Certified Marketers and Accredited Producers can be found at the following website: http://www.bq9000.org.

Biodiesel contains residual ash. Ash levels exceeding the maximums allowed in either ASTM D6751 or EN14214 can result in more rapid ash loading and require more frequent cleaning of the Exhaust Filter (if present).

The fuel filter can require more frequent replacement when using biodiesel fuel, particularly if switching from diesel. Check engine oil level daily prior to starting engine. A rising oil level can indicate fuel dilution of the engine oil. Biodiesel blends up to B20 must be used within 90 days of the date of biodiesel manufacture. Biodiesel blends above B20 must be used within 45 days from the date of biodiesel manufacture.

When using biodiesel blends up to B20, the following must be considered:

Cold-weather flow degradation

Stability and storage issues (moisture absorption, microbial growth)

Possible filter restriction and plugging (usually a problem when first switching to biodiesel on used engines)

Possible fuel leakage through seals and hoses (primarily an issue with older engines)

Possible reduction of service life of engine components

Request a certificate of analysis from your fuel distributor to ensure that the fuel is compliant with the specifications provided in this Operator’s Manual.

Consult your John Deere dealer for John Deere fuel products to improve storage and performance with biodiesel fuels.

The following must also be considered if using biodiesel blends above B20:

Possible coking or blocked injector nozzles, resulting in power loss and engine misfire if John Deere fuel additives and conditioners or equivalent containing detergent/dispersants are not used

Possible crankcase oil dilution (requiring more frequent oil changes)

Possible lacquering or seizure of internal components

Possible formation of sludge and sediments

Possible thermal oxidation of fuel at elevated temperatures

Possible compatibility issues with other materials (including copper, lead, zinc, tin, brass, and bronze) used in fuel handling, distribution, and storage equipment

Possible reduction in water separator efficiency

Possible damage to paint if exposed to biodiesel

Possible corrosion of fuel injection equipment

Possible elastomeric seal and gasket material degradation (primarily an issue with older engines)

Possible high acid levels within fuel system

Because biodiesel blends above B20 contain more ash, using blends above B20 can result in more rapid ash loading and require more frequent cleaning of the Exhaust Filter (if present)

Raw pressed vegetable oils are NOT acceptable for use as fuel in any concentration in John Deere engines. Their use could cause engine failure."
Fuels and Lubricants,Lubricity of Diesel Fuel,"Most diesel fuels manufactured in the United States, Canada, and the European Union have adequate lubricity to ensure proper operation and durability of fuel injection system components. However, diesel fuels manufactured in some areas of the world may lack the necessary lubricity.

Make sure the diesel fuel used in your machine demonstrates good lubricity characteristics.

Fuel lubricity should pass a maximum scar diameter of 0.52 mm as measured by ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1. A maximum scar diameter of 0.45 mm is preferred.

If fuel of low or unknown lubricity is used, add John Deere Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (or equivalent) at the specified concentration.

Lubricity of BioDiesel Fuel

Fuel lubricity can improve significantly with BioDiesel blends up to B20 (20% BioDiesel). Further increase in lubricity is limited for BioDiesel blends greater than B20."
Fuels and Lubricants,Supplemental Diesel Fuel Additives,"Diesel fuel can be the source of performance or other operational problems for many reasons. Some causes include poor lubricity, contaminants, low cetane number, and a variety of properties that cause fuel system deposits. These and others are referenced in other sections of this Operator's Manual.

To optimize engine performance and reliability, closely follow recommendations on fuel quality, storage, and handling, which are found elsewhere in this Operator's Manual.

To further aid in maintaining performance and reliability of the engine's fuel system, John Deere has developed a family of fuel additive products for most global markets. The primary products include Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (full feature conditioner in winter and summer formulas) and Fuel-Protect Keep Clean (fuel injector deposit removal and prevention). Availability of these and other products varies by market. See your local John Deere dealer for availability and additional information about fuel additives that might be right for your needs."
Fuels and Lubricants,Testing Diesel Fuel,"A fuel analysis program can help to monitor the quality of diesel fuel. The fuel analysis can provide critical data such as calculated cetane index, fuel type, sulfur content, water content, appearance, suitability for cold weather operations, bacteria, cloud point, acid number, particulate contamination, and whether the fuel meets ASTM D975 or equivalent specification.

Contact your John Deere dealer for more information on diesel fuel analysis."
Fuels and Lubricants,Minimizing the Effect of Cold Weather on Diesel Engines,"John Deere diesel engines are designed to operate effectively in cold weather.

However, for effective starting and cold-weather operation, a little extra care is necessary. The following information outlines steps that can minimize the effect that cold weather may have on starting and operation of your engine. See your John Deere dealer for additional information and local availability of cold-weather aids.

When temperatures fall below 0°C (32°F), winter grade fuel (No. 1-D in North America) is best suited for cold-weather operation. Winter grade fuel has a lower cloud point and a lower pour point.

Cloud point is the temperature at which wax begins to form in the fuel. This wax causes fuel filters to plug. Pour point is the lowest temperature at which movement of the fuel is observed.

On average, winter grade diesel fuel has a lower Btu (heat content) rating. Using winter grade fuel may reduce power and fuel efficiency, but should not cause any other engine performance effects. Check the grade of fuel being used before troubleshooting for low-power complaints in cold-weather operation.

An air intake heater is an available option for some engines to aid cold weather starting.

An ether port on the intake is available to aid cold weather starting.

Ether is highly flammable. Do not use ether when starting an engine equipped with glow plugs or an air intake heater.

An engine block heater (coolant heater) is an available option to aid cold weather starting.

Use seasonal grade viscosity engine oil based on the expected air temperature range between oil changes and a proper concentration of low silicate antifreeze as recommended. (See DIESEL ENGINE OIL and ENGINE COOLANT requirements in this section.)

Use John Deere Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (winter formula), which contains anti-gel chemistry, or equivalent fuel conditioner to treat non-winter grade fuel (No. 2-D in North America) during the cold-weather season. This generally extends operability to about 10°C (18°F) below the fuel cloud point. For operability at even lower temperatures, use winter grade fuel.

Treat fuel when outside temperature drops below 0°C (32°F). For best results, use with untreated fuel. Follow all recommended instructions on label.

When operating with biodiesel blends, wax formation can occur at warmer temperatures. Begin using John Deere Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (winter formula) or equivalent at 5°C (41°F) to treat biodiesel fuels during the cold-weather season. Use B5 or lower blends at temperatures below 0°C (32°F). Use only winter grade petroleum diesel fuel at temperatures below -10°C (14°F).

Use of fabric, cardboard, or solid winterfronts is not recommended with any John Deere engine. Their use can result in excessive engine coolant, oil, and charge air temperatures. This can lead to reduced engine life, loss of power and poor fuel economy. Winterfronts may also put abnormal stress on fan and fan drive components potentially causing premature failures.

If winterfronts are used, they should never totally close off the grill frontal area. Approximately 25% area in the center of the grill should remain open at all times. At no time should the air blockage device be applied directly to the radiator core.

If equipped with a thermostatically controlled radiator shutter system, this system should be regulated in such a way that the shutters are completely open by the time the coolant reaches 93°C (200°F) to prevent excessive intake manifold temperatures. Manually controlled systems are not recommended.

If air-to-air aftercooling is used, the shutters must be completely open by the time the intake manifold air temperature reaches the maximum allowable temperature out of the charge air cooler.

For more information, see your John Deere dealer."
Fuels and Lubricants,Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) — Use in Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Equipped Engines,"In order to maintain the emissions performance of the engine, it is essential to use and refill DEF in accordance with the specification.

Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is a high purity liquid that is injected into the exhaust system of engines equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems. Maintaining the purity of DEF is important to avoid malfunctions in the SCR system. Engines requiring DEF shall use a product that meets the requirements for aqueous urea solution 32 (AUS 32) according to ISO 22241-1.

The use of John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid is recommended. John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid is available at your John Deere dealer in a variety of package sizes to suit your operational needs.

If John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid is not available, use DEF that is certified by the American Petroleum Institute (API) Diesel Exhaust Fluid Certification Program or by the AdBlueAdBlue is a trademark of VDA, the German Association of the Automotive Industry. Diesel Exhaust Fluid Certification Program. Look for the API certification symbol or the AdBlue™ name on the container.

In some cases, DEF is referred to by one or more of these names:

Urea

Aqueous Urea Solution 32

AUS 32

AdBlue™

NOx Reduction Agent

Catalyst Solution"
Fuels and Lubricants,Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF),"Using DEF with the correct concentration is critical to engine and aftertreatment system performance. Extended storage and other conditions can adversely alter the DEF concentration.

If DEF quality is questionable, draw a sample out of the DEF tank or storage tank into a clear container. DEF must be crystal clear with a light ammonia smell. If DEF appears cloudy, has a colored tint, or has a profound ammonia smell, it is likely not within specification. DEF in this condition should not be used. Drain tank, flush with distilled water and refill with new or good DEF. After refilling the tank, check the DEF concentration.

If the DEF passes the visual and smell test, check the DEF concentration with a handheld refractometer calibrated to measure DEF.

DEF concentration should be checked when the engine has been stored for extended periods, or if there is suspicion the engine or packaged DEF fluid has been contaminated with water.

Two approved tools are available through your John Deere dealer:

JDG11594 Digital DEF Refractometer—A digital tool providing an easy to read concentration measurement DEF Refractometer, Digital JDG11594 Test the DEF concentration.

JDG11684 DEF Refractometer—Low-cost alternative tool providing an analog reading DEF Refractometer JDG11684 Test the DEF concentration.

Follow instructions included with either tool to obtain the measurement.

The correct DEF concentration is 31.8—33.2% urea. If the DEF concentration is not within specification, drain the DEF tank, flush with distilled water and fill with new or good DEF. If packaged DEF is not within specification, dispose of DEF packages and replace with new or good DEF."
Fuels and Lubricants,Storing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF),"Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with large amounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes. Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional information.

Do not ingest DEF. In the event DEF is ingested, contact a physician immediately. Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional information.

It is unlawful to tamper with or remove any component of the aftertreatment system. Do not use DEF that does not meet the required specifications or operate the engine with no DEF.

Never attempt to create DEF by mixing agricultural grade urea with water. Agricultural grade urea does not meet the necessary specifications and can damage the aftertreatment system.

Do not add any chemicals or additives to DEF in an effort to prevent freezing. Any chemicals or additives added to DEF can damage the aftertreatment system.

Never add water or any other fluid in place of, or in addition to DEF. Operating with a modified DEF or using an unapproved DEF can damage the aftertreatment system.

Storage information provided below is for reference and is to be used as a guideline only.

It is preferred to store DEF out of extreme ambient temperatures. DEF freezes at –11°C (12°F). Exposure to temperatures greater than 30°C (86°F) can degrade DEF over time. Do not store DEF in direct sunlight.

Dedicated DEF storage containers must be sealed between uses to prevent evaporation and contamination. Containers made of polyethylene, polypropylene, or stainless steel are recommended to transport and store DEF.

Ideal conditions for storage of DEF are:

Store at temperatures between –5°C and 30°C (23°F and 86°F)

Store in dedicated containers sealed to avoid contamination and evaporation

Under these conditions, DEF is expected to remain useable for a minimum of 18 months. Storing DEF at higher temperatures can reduce its useful life by approximately 6 months for every 5°C (9°F) temperature above 30°C (86°F).

If unsure how long or under what conditions DEF has been stored, test DEF. See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).

Long-term storage in the DEF tank (over 12 months) is not recommended. If long-term storage is necessary, test DEF prior to operating engine. See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).

It is recommended to purchase DEF in quantities that will be consumed within 12 months."
Fuels and Lubricants,Refilling Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank,"Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with large amounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes. Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional information.

Do not ingest DEF. In the event DEF is ingested, contact a physician immediately. Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional information.

Use only distilled water to rinse components that are used to deliver DEF. Tap water can contaminate DEF. If distilled water is not available, rinse with clean tap water, then thoroughly rinse with ample amounts of DEF.

If DEF is spilled or contacts any surface other than the storage tank, immediately clean the surface with clear water. DEF is corrosive to painted and unpainted metallic surfaces and can distort some plastic and rubber components.

If DEF is filled into engine fuel tank or other fluid compartment, do not operate engine until system is properly purged of DEF. Contact your John Deere dealer immediately to determine how to clean and purge the system.

Reasonable care should be taken when refilling the DEF tank. Ensure that the DEF tank cap area is free of debris before removing the cap. Seal containers of DEF between use to prevent contamination and evaporation.

Avoid splashing DEF and do not allow DEF to come into contact with skin, eyes, or mouth.

DEF is not harmful to handle, but DEF can be corrosive to materials such as steel, iron, zinc, nickel, copper, aluminum, and magnesium. Use suitable containers to transport and store DEF. Containers made of polyethylene, polypropylene, or stainless steel are recommended.

Avoid prolonged contact with skin. In case of accidental contact, wash skin immediately with soap and water.

Keep anything used to store or dispense DEF clean of dirt and dust. Wash and rinse containers or funnels thoroughly with distilled water to remove contaminants.

If an unapproved fluid, such as diesel fuel or coolant is added to the DEF tank, contact your John Deere dealer immediately to determine how to clean and purge the system.

If water has been added to the DEF tank, a tank cleaning is necessary. See Cleaning DEF Tank in this manual. After refilling the tank, check the DEF concentration. See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).

The operator must maintain appropriate DEF levels at all times. Check the DEF level daily and refill the tank as needed. The filling port is identified by a blue colored cap embossed with the following DEF symbol."
Fuels and Lubricants,Disposal of Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF),"Although there is little issue with minor spillage of DEF on the ground, large amounts of DEF should be contained. If large spills occur, contact local environmental authorities for assistance with clean-up.

If a substantial quantity of DEF is not within specification, contact the DEF supplier for assistance with disposal. Do not dump substantial quantities of DEF onto the ground or send DEF to wastewater treatment facilities."
Fuels and Lubricants,Diesel Engine Coolant (engine with wet sleeve cylinder liners),"Failure to follow applicable coolant standards and drain intervals can result in severe engine damage that may not be covered under warranty. Warranties, including the emissions warranty, are not conditioned on the use of John Deere coolants, parts, or service.

The following pre-mix engine coolants are preferred:

Use COOL-GARD II PG when a non-toxic coolant formulation is required.

The following engine coolant is also recommended:

John Deere COOL-GARD II Concentrate in a 40—60% mixture of concentrate with quality water.

When mixing coolant concentrate with water, do not use less than 40% or greater than 60% concentration of coolant. Less than 40% gives inadequate additives for corrosion protection. Greater than 60% can result in coolant gelation and cooling system problems.

Other ethylene glycol or propylene glycol base coolants may be used if they meet the following specification:

Pre-mix coolant meeting ASTM D6210 requirements

Is formulated with a 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA) free additive package

Coolant concentrate meeting ASTM D6210 requirements in a 40—60% mixture of concentrate with quality water

If coolant meeting one of these specifications is unavailable, use a coolant concentrate or pre-mix coolant that has a minimum of the following chemical and physical properties:

Provides cylinder liner cavitation protection according to either the John Deere Cavitation Test Method or a fleet study run at or above 60% load capacity

Is formulated with a nitrite-free additive package

Is formulated with a 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA) free additive package

Protects the cooling system metals (cast iron, aluminum alloys, and copper alloys such as brass) from corrosion

Water quality is important to the performance of the cooling system. Deionized or demineralized water is recommended for mixing with ethylene glycol and propylene glycol base engine coolant concentrate.

Drain and flush the cooling system and refill with fresh coolant at the indicated interval, which varies with the coolant used.

When COOL-GARD II or COOL-GARD II PG is used, the drain interval is 6 years or 6000 hours of operation.

If a coolant other than COOL-GARD II or COOL-GARD II PG is used, reduce the drain interval to 2 years or 2000 hours of operation.Coolant analysis may extend the service interval of other ""Coolants"" to a maximum not to exceed the interval of Cool-Gard II coolants. Coolant analysis means taking a series of coolant samples at 1000 hour increments beyond the normal service interval until either the data indicate the end of useful coolant life or the maximum service interval of Cool-Gard II is reached.

Do not use cooling system sealing additives or antifreeze that contains sealing additives.

Do not mix ethylene glycol and propylene glycol base coolants.

Do not use coolants that contain nitrites.

For COOL-GARDCOOL-GARD is a trademark of Deere & Company II pre-mix and COOL-GARD II Concentrate, replenish coolant additives between drain intervals by adding COOL-GARD II Coolant Extender.

COOL-GARD II Coolant Extender should not be added unless indicated by COOL-GARD II Test Strips. These test strips provide a simple, effective method to check the freeze point, additive levels, and pH of your engine coolant.

Test the coolant solution at intervals of 12 months and whenever excessive coolant is lost through leaks or overheating.

Do not use COOL-GARD II Test Strips with COOL-GARD II PG.

COOL-GARD II Coolant Extender is a chemically matched additive system for use with all COOL-GARD II coolants. COOL-GARD II Coolant Extender is not intended for use with nitrite-containing coolants.

Do not add a supplemental coolant additive when the cooling system is drained and refilled with any of the following:

John Deere COOL-GARD II

Fuels and Lubricants,Operating in Warm Temperature Climates,"John Deere engines are designed to operate using recommended engine coolants.

Always use a recommended engine coolant, even when operating in geographical areas where freeze protection is not required.

Water may be used as coolant in emergency situations only.

Foaming, hot surface aluminum and iron corrosion, scaling, and cavitation occur when water is used as the coolant, even when coolant conditioners are added.

Drain cooling system and refill with recommended engine coolant as soon as possible."
Fuels and Lubricants,Water Quality for Mixing with Coolant Concentrate,"Engine coolants are a combination of three chemical components: ethylene glycol (EG) or propylene glycol (PG) antifreeze, inhibiting coolant additives, and quality water.

Water quality is important to the performance of the cooling system. Deionized or demineralized water is recommended for mixing with ethylene glycol and propylene glycol base engine coolant concentrate.

All water used in the cooling system should meet the following minimum specifications for quality:

Maintenance—Every 10 Hours,Engine Oil Level,"Engine Dipstick ADipstick BADD Mark CFULL Mark It is vital to maintain the engine oil at correct levels to ensure a long service life. Check the engine oil level with the machine parked on level ground.

Verify that the dipstick is pushed completely into the housing before removing to check the engine oil level.

For the most accurate oil level reading, check the engine oil when the engine has been off for at least 90 minutes and the machine is parked on level ground. An oil level reading within the cross-hatch area is acceptable.

Check the engine oil level with dipstick (A) daily. Do not operate the engine when the oil level is below the ""ADD"" mark (B) on the dipstick.

Remove the dipstick and check the oil level.

The oil level should be between the ""ADD"" mark and the ""FULL"" mark (C) on the dipstick. If the oil level is below the ""ADD"" mark, add oil as needed. See Fuels and Lubricants section for oil recommendations."

Maintenance—As Required (Engine Fluids and Filters),Diesel Particulate Filter Aftertreatment Replacement (Stage V),"Diesel Particulate Filter The exhaust filter includes the diesel oxidation catalyst and diesel particulate filter (DPF). The DPF is designed to retain residual ash, which is a noncombustible result of additives used in crankcase lubrication oils and the fuel. The DPF provides many hours of maintenance-free operation. At some point, the DPF requires professional service or replacement to remove the accumulated ash. The exact number of hours of operation before service or replacement is required varies depending upon the engine’s power category, duty cycle and operating conditions, engine oil ash content, and fuel quality. Adhering to John Deere’s recommended oil and fuel specifications will maximize the hours of operation before professional DPF service or replacement is required.

As the engine owner, you are responsible for performing the required maintenance described in your Operator’s Manual. During normal equipment operation, the DPF maintenance requirements will depend on the rate at which ash accumulates in it. DPFs on engines above 175 hp/130 kW may require service or replacement at about 4500 hours. As ash levels rise in the DPF, the capacity for soot storage is reduced and the back pressure of the exhaust system will rise more frequently. A diagnostic trouble code will appear, indicating when the DPF needs servicing.

The removal of DPF ash must be done by removing the DPF from the machine and placing it into specialized equipment. Do not remove ash by using water or chemicals. Removing ash by these methods may damage the material securing the DPF in its canister, resulting in the loosening of the DPF element in the canister and subjecting it to damage from vibration.

Failure to follow the approved ash removal methods may violate U.S. federal, state, and local hazardous waste laws, and may also damage the DPF, resulting in potential denial of the diesel exhaust filter emissions warranty. It is strongly recommended you take the DPF to an authorized John Deere service location or other qualified service provider for service or replacement.

When AUTO or PARKED cleaning is enabled, the exhaust temperature may be high under no load or light load conditions at certain times during the exhaust filter cleaning cycle.

Disable exhaust filter cleaning system in conditions where it may be unsafe for elevated exhaust temperatures.

Long-term storage in vehicle (over 12 months) is not recommended. If long-term storage is necessary, periodic testing of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is recommended to ensure that urea concentration does not fall out of specification.

Final Tier 4/Stage V: Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) has a limited shelf life, but it may be stored in the vehicle for as long as 12 months, depending upon storage conditions. See Storing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) and Refilling Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank in Fuels and Lubricants section for further information. See Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank—Filling and Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank—Draining in Maintenance—As Required (Engine Fluids and Filters) section for further information.

Final Tier 4/Stage V: Do not disconnect battery for at least 90 seconds after machine is shut OFF. Selective catalyst reduction (SCR) system automatically purges lines of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) during this time, immediately after machine is shut OFF. If adequate time is not allowed for lines to be purged, any fluid remaining in lines can crystallize and plug lines. Fluid freezes and possibly burst lines in freezing weather conditions.

Turn battery disconnect switch OFF if machine is stored longer than 25 days. If storage period is longer than 90 days, remove negative lead to batteries to minimize load to batteries.

Charge batteries completely. Specific gravity equals 1.260 volts. To minimize load to the batteries, remove the negative lead to the batteries.

It is not necessary to wax the machine. However, if desired, use a good clear wax that contains no abrasives. These types of waxes usually do not contain cleaners.

Lubricate machine and grease adjusting bolt threads.

Perform all 400 hours (yearly) services.

To prevent condensation, fill fuel tank.

To stabilize the fuel and prevent water condensation, add fuel conditioner when the following occurs:

Fuel is stored in the fuel tanks (machine or farm storage) for extended periods of time. See your John Deere dealer for recommendations.

A slow turnover of fuel is being used. See your John Deere dealer for recommendations.

For prolonged machine storage, the best practice is to drain biodiesel and fill machine with regular petroleum diesel fuel. Otherwise, use biodiesel stabilizer (anti-oxidant) additives or fully formulated biodiesel conditioners. See your John Deere dealer for recommendations.

If machine is to be stored for a long period, remove and clean the batteries. Store them in a cool, dry place and keep them fully charged.

Before storing the machine, the air compressor reservoir (if equipped) MUST be drained of water.

It is recommended to lower the feeder house roughly 50 mm (2 in) before shutting the machine off for long term storage or service."
Storage,Removing Machine from Storage,"Reconnect and/or charge batteries.

Charge batteries completely. Specific gravity equals 1.260 volts. To minimize load to the batteries, remove negative lead to the batteries.

Check oil and coolant levels. Inspect for leaks and add oil and coolant if needed.

Final Tier 4/Stage V: If diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) tank was not drained, test urea concentration. See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) in Fuels and Lubricants section for further information. If concentration is not within specifications, drain and replace with new diesel exhaust fluid (DEF). If diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) tank was drained, fill tank. See Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank—Filling in Maintenance—As Required (Engine Fluids and Filters) section for further information.

Replace the ActiveVisionActiveVision is a trademark of Deere & Company clean grain elevator camera and tailings system camera desiccant cartridge (if equipped). See ActiveVision™ Camera Desiccant Cartridge in Maintenance—Every 400 Hours section for further information.

Close elevator doors and drain hole.

Check tension of drive belts. Adjust spring-loaded idlers until the washer is positioned between the end of the gauge and the bottom of the step.

Check tire inflation and review machine Operator's Manual.

Inspect fire extinguishers (front and left-hand side) by following maintenance instructions on the fire extinguisher label. Recharge or replace as necessary."

Make sure that fastener threads are clean.

Apply a thin coat of Hy-Gard™ or equivalent oil under the head and on the threads of the fastener, as shown in the following image.

Be conservative with the amount of oil to reduce the potential for hydraulic lockup in blind holes due to excessive oil.

Properly start thread engagement.

The nominal torque values listed are for general use only with the assumed wrenching accuracy of 20%, such as a manual torque wrench.

DO NOT use these values if a different torque value or tightening procedure is given for a specific application.

For lock nuts, for stainless steel fasteners, or for nuts on U-bolts, see the tightening instructions for the specific application.

Replace fasteners with the same or higher property class. If higher property class fasteners are used, tighten these to the strength of the original.

Make sure that fastener threads are clean.

Apply a thin coat of Hy-Gard™ or equivalent oil under the head and on the threads of the fastener, as shown in the following image.

Be conservative with the amount of oil to reduce the potential for hydraulic lockup in blind holes due to excessive oil.
